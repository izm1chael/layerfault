# candelabra

`candelabra` is a small Rust crate for desktop applications that want to run
quantized GGUF models (LLaMA, Qwen, Phi, Gemma, etc.) with
[`candle-core`](https://crates.io/crates/candle-core),
[`candle-transformers`](https://crates.io/crates/candle-transformers), and
[`hf-hub`](https://crates.io/crates/hf-hub).

It focuses on the pieces GUI apps usually need:

- Hugging Face downloads that respect the local `hf-hub` cache
- tokenizer loading helpers
- optional Metal or CUDA device selection with CPU fallback
- reusable loaded model state
- token streaming with cancellation support
- optional profiled inference telemetry for benchmark-style callers

## Current Scope

`candelabra` natively supports quantized GGUF checkpoints with dynamic architecture detection.
Supported architectures include:
- `llama` / `mistral` / `mixtral` / `gemma` / `gemma2`
- `phi` / `phi2`
- `phi3`
- `qwen2` (Qwen 2, Qwen 2.5, QwQ)
- `qwen3`
- `qwen3moe` when the `qwen3-moe` feature is enabled with a Candle build that
  exposes `models::quantized_qwen3_moe`
- `gemma3`
- `glm4`
- `lfm2` (including current LFM2.5 GGUFs that advertise `lfm2`)
- `smollm3`

Qwen3.5 GGUFs are detected explicitly, but are not run through the Qwen3
backend. They use a newer hybrid Gated DeltaNet + attention architecture that
requires a dedicated Candle backend before candelabra can support them safely.

That means the crate is a good fit if you want a lightweight Rust API for local
desktop inference on models such as Qwen 2.5 or SmolLM GGUF variants. 
It abstracts away the `candle_transformers::models` paths into a single unified `Model` block.

## Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
candelabra = "0.2.0"
```

By default, `candelabra` builds CPU-only so library consumers can choose their
own Candle backend policy. Enable GPU backends explicitly:

```toml
[dependencies]
candelabra = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["metal", "accelerate"] } # macOS
```

```toml
[dependencies]
candelabra = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["cuda"] } # NVIDIA CUDA
```

```toml
[dependencies]
candelabra = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["qwen3-moe"] } # optional Qwen3 MoE GGUF backend
```

Applications that patch Candle, such as to use CUDA dynamic loading, should keep
the `[patch.crates-io]` entries in the application workspace root and enable the
matching `candelabra` feature there.

## Quick Start

```rust,no_run
use candelabra::{
    download_model,
    load_tokenizer_from_repo,
    run_inference,
    InferenceConfig,
    Model,
};
use std::sync::{
    Arc,
    atomic::AtomicBool,
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let model_path = download_model(
        "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF",
        "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf",
    )?;
    let tokenizer = load_tokenizer_from_repo("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct")?;
    let mut model = Model::load(&model_path)?;
    let cancel_token = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));

    let mut config = InferenceConfig::default();
    config.prompt = "<|im_start|>user\nTell me a story about a helpful robot.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n".to_string();

    let result = run_inference(
        &mut model,
        &tokenizer,
        &config,
        cancel_token,
        |token| {
            print!("{token}");
            Ok(())
        },
    )?;

    println!("\n{:.2} tokens/s", result.tokens_per_second);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Main API

- `download_model()` downloads a model file through the local Hugging Face cache.
- `download_model_with_progress()` and `download_model_with_channel()` emit
  progress updates suitable for UI progress bars.
- `load_tokenizer_from_repo()` downloads and loads `tokenizer.json`.
- `Model::load()` loads a quantized GGUF model onto the best available
  device, dynamically instantiating the correct Candle architecture based on metadata.
- `Model::architecture()` returns the GGUF architecture name reported by the
  model metadata.
- `Model::reset_state()` reloads weights on the selected device to clear backend-owned KV/cache state between isolated runs.
- `run_inference()` streams generated tokens through a callback.
- `run_inference_profiled()` returns `ProfiledInferenceResult` with prompt-processing, decode, first-token, callback, and stop-reason telemetry for benchmarks.
- `run_inference_with_channel()` streams generated tokens over a Tokio channel.
- `InferenceConfig::stop_on_eos` controls whether generation stops when a common EOS token is sampled; it defaults to `true`.

## Platform Notes

- With the `metal` feature enabled on macOS, the crate prefers Metal and falls
  back to CPU.
- With the `cuda` feature enabled on non-macOS platforms, the crate prefers CUDA
  and falls back to CPU.
- Without a GPU backend feature, the crate stays CPU-only.
- The public `device_used` string is intended to be easy to surface directly in
  desktop UIs.
